# bind game to 27632 port to get serverlist
# required to get serverlist from gameranger + SNAT server (without server files modification)
# option is restricting one game instance per computer, not required when server has removed serverlist broadcasting
# remove option or set to -1 to disable it
# use it only when server in `known_servers` requires it to display serverlist
# uncomment next line to enable:

# known server list in format <ip>:<port>
# example:
# known_servers = [
#     "12.34.56.78:27632",
#     "10.10.10.10:27631"
# ]
