Server List Mod made by MX. This brings back the servers on the defunct server list on the "LAN" option in Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood

INSTALLATION

- Extract the files to the folder
- Copy all file contents to your main Call of Juarez Bound in Blood folder (also works on Steam, browse local files of the game on Steam and then paste the files to the main Steam game folder)
- Launch the game - you should have servers visible on the LAN option

With this mod you don't need to use additional software such as GameRanger
